# EDUNET-WEEK3-FINAL
# 🌾 Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System

A machine learning-based system built using Python to recommend suitable crops and fertilizers based on environmental and soil data. This project is part of **EDUNET Week 3** and demonstrates practical ML applications in agriculture.

## 📌 Overview

This project includes:
- A **Crop Recommendation** model trained on features like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- A **Fertilizer Recommendation** model based on current vs ideal soil nutrient values.
- Jupyter notebooks for model building, training, and testing.
- CSV datasets and `.sav` models saved using `pickle` for easy reuse.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Predict the best crop to grow based on input conditions
- 🌱 Suggest the right fertilizer to balance soil nutrients
- 📁 Clean and structured datasets
- 🧠 Trained ML models ready for deployment
- ✅ Interactive Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Pickle (for model serialization)
